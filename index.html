Spread across the floodplains of the Brahmaputra River, its forests, wetlands and grasslands are home to tigers, elephants and the world’s largest population of Indian one-horned rhinoceroses. Ganges River dolphins swim in the park’s waters. It’s visited by many rare migratory birds, and gray pelicans roost near Kaziranga village.</p>

              <p class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-xs-12">Current monitoring methods either don’t have the capacity to scale globally, or simply don’t have the required resolutions––and fine-scale data is often not within reach. Governments and administrations have been slow to install measures; meanwhile, private sector employers desire the competitive advantages that come with ‘green’ credentials, but don’t always know how to contribute effectively, leading to green-washing and wasted resources. In addition, employees prefer to work for companies with a good environmental record and welcome a chance to volunteer and participate, but engagement is often symbolic or short-term. </p>

              <p class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-xs-12">Fast-moving wildfires in southern California have seriously injured two firefighters as of Monday, and forced over 100,000 people to evacuate in what has been referred to as the worst wildfire season the state has seen on record.
Out of the six largest wildfires in California recorded since 1932, five occurred in 2020. The largest out of these were in August, called the August Complex fires, and burned an area of about 1,032,264 acres, resulting in one death. This year has also seen the most destructive and deadliest wildfires, with the North Complex wildfire coming at number five in both the categories since the records have been maintained. </p>

                      <p>A Wrinkle in Time is a young adult novel written by American author Madeleine L'Engle. First published in 1962,[2] the book has won the Newbery Medal, the Sequoyah Book Award, the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award, and was runner-up for the Hans Christian Andersen Award.[3][a] The main characters—Meg Murry, Charles Wallace Murry, and Calvin O'Keefe—embark on a journey through space and time, from universe to universe, as they endeavor to save the Murrys' father and the world. The novel offers a glimpse into the war between light and darkness, and good and evil, as the young characters mature into adolescents on their journey.[4] The novel wrestles with questions of spirituality and purpose, as the characters are often thrown into conflicts of love, divinity, and goodness.[4] It is the first book in L'Engle's Time Quintet, which follows the Murrys and Calvin O'Keefe.</p>
